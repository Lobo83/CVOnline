#content
content.personal.carta=To whom it may concern,\nGiven my experience in IT projects, as much in technological feature as team and customer management, I think I could fit the offered position.\nDuring my professional career I have worked with customer in different sectors: Pharmaceutical, Telecommunication, Energy\u2026 In all of these projects I have performed Technical tasks (Analysis, Design, Implementation and Test) as well as Team Leading (national and international teams) and Customer management\nIn personal feature, I am a self taught person, I do worry about keeping me up to date in technology (on my own or with the company trainings) and that allows me to adapt quickly to any kind of project or position.\nIn relationships, I am an opened person who likes work in team and to know new people. It is quite easy for me setting up networking with the people I work with. I like to create  a good environment in my team as well as to transmit confidence to the customer contact people.\nThank you so much in advance for considering my CV,\nYours sincerely,\nJose Luis Antón Bueso
